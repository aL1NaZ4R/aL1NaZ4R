Ayo, It's Ali Nazer!

I enjoy coding as a hobby. Games, Modding, Applications or Webpages. Code is code for me.

My main focus is on playing Games, for now. I'm extremely obsessed with osu! and VALORANT.

However, I wish to form a small group of indie developers in the future. But not a serious thing, tbh.
