### Welcome to Ali Nazer's Profile ðŸ‘‹

Hello, My name is Ali Nazer.

I love Coding. Game or Mod, App or Software. No matter.
But I'm focusing on game development, Since I'm a gamer and experienced how it feels. So, I have many ideas and concepts for developing a game.
If you want to work together, feel free to contact me!

However, I have a small group of indie developers. It's name is Lambda Nexus. We're currently working on some small projects. But it's acutally not a serious work. bruh
